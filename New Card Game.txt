Card Values:
Ace: 1
Number Cards: the number corresponding with each card.
Jack: 11
Queen: 12
King: 13

Each side starts with 5 cards face down.
Neither side may look at their cards.
Each side can either flip one of their cards, or pick one from the deck.
Note: You can only choose to either flip a card, or draw a card from the deck a total of 5 times.
	ex: 3 flips, 2 draws.
If they flip their card, then player's score is player's score + the card.
If they choose one from the deck, then they get one card face down.
Player wins by beating the other player in score.
Bonus cards are added to deck that can either help the player, harm the other player, or harm the player.
	Ex: Master Spark card subtracts 5 from other player's score.
	Multiplier multiplies all points recieved by the player by 2.
	Error 404 subtracts 4 from the player's score and 1 from all points recieved by the player.

After the match, all cards are put back in the deck and the deck is reshuffled.
