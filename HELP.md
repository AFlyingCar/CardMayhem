==========
Card Mayhem is a card game that uses a series of wild (or specialized) cards as well as the default deck of 52. 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Game Rules<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
1) Every player starts off with 5 cards face down.
2) Each player gets 5 turns to either flip a card in their deck, or to flip a card from the main Deck.
3) The game ends once all 5 of these turns have been used up.
4) Every card you get will add to your score (The number on the card will indicate how many points you get).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Special Card System<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
1) There are currently four Wild Cards.
2) Wild Cards will not add any points to your score.
3) Wild Cards are used the instant they are flipped. You cannot hold onto them.
